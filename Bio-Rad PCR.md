## General Description  
<p align="justify">The Bio-rad C1000 Touch thermal cycler offers superior performance and a large color touch screen that enable easy programming and monitoring of the Amplification/PCR reaction. The machine is also suitable for other experiments like Cloning, Cycle sequencing, Gene expression studies, Mutagenesis, etc. C1000 touch has a fully adjustable heated lid that supports a wide range of vessels and sealers, including low-profile and standard-height PCR plates. The fully modular platform can accommodate different throughput needs with easily interchangeable reaction modules that swap in seconds without tools. The Protocol Autowriter of the machine offers various programming options and automatically generates customized standard, fast, and ultrafast protocols. Its flexible platform increases the throughput capability by linking up to three additional thermal cyclers or adding PC control for up to thirty-two thermal cyclers. C1000 quickly and easily identifies optimal annealing temperatures for PCR reactions by using the programmable thermal gradient system.

The C1000 Touch thermal cycler can run on six interchangeable reaction modules:  
- A gradient-enabled 96-well fast module.
- A gradient-enabled 96â€“deep well module.
- A gradient-enabled dual 48/48-well fast module that allows two independently controlled protocols to be run side by side in a single bay.
- A gradient-enabled 384-well module for high throughput.
- Two modules for real-time PCR detection.
