<h1 align="center">Electron Microscopy</h1>

## Introduction
<p align="justify">The fundamental principles of electron microscopy are similar to those of light microscopy except one major difference of using electromagnetic lenses, rather than optical lenses to focus a high-velocity electron beam instead of visible light. The relationship between the limit of resolution and the wavelength of the illuminating radiation hold true for both â€“ a beam of light or a beam of electrons. Due to the short wavelength of electrons, the resolving power of the electron microscope is very high.</p>
