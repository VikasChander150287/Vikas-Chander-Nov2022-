<h1 align="center">Extracellular Vesicles</h1>

## Introduction
<p align="justify">Extracellular vesicles(EVs) are lipid bilayer-delimited particles that are naturally released from almost all types of cells and, unlike a cell, cannot replicate. EVs range in diameter from near the size of the smallest physically possible unilamellar liposome (around 20-30 nanometers) to as large as 10 microns or more, although the vast majority of EVs are smaller than 200 nm.</p>


## Types of Extracellular Vesicles
EVs can be divided according to size and synthesis route into 
1. Exosomes
2. Microvesicles
3. Apoptotic bodies

### Exosomes:
<p align="justify">Exosomes are membrane-bound EVs that are produced in the endosomal compartment of most eukaryotic cells. The multivesicular body (MVB) is an endosome with intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) that bud inward into the endosomal lumen. If the MVB fuses with the cell surface (the plasma membrane), these ILVs are released as exosomes.</p>

### MicroVesicles:
<p align="justify">Microvesicles (ectosomes, or microparticles) are a type of  EVs that are released from the cell membrane. In multicellular organisms, microvesicles and other EVs are found both in tissues (in the interstitial space between cells) and in many types of body fluids. Delimited by a phospholipid bilayer, microvesicles can be as small as the smallest EVs (30 nm in diameter) or as large as 1000 nm.</p>

### Apoptotic Bodies:
<p align="justify">Apoptotic bodies are EVs that are released by dying cells undergoing apoptosis. Since apoptotic cells tend to display phosphatidylserine (PS) in the outer bilayer of the cell membrane, apoptotic bodies tend to externalize PS, although other EVs may also do so. Apoptotic bodies may be quite large (microns in diameter) but may also measure in the submicron range.</p>

## Biological Fuctions of EVs
A wide variety of biological functions have been ascribed to EVs, such as:
- Trash disposal (eliminating unwanted materials).
- Transfer of functional proteins.
- Transfer of functional DNA and RNA.
- Molecular recycling or “nutrition”.
- Signaling to the recipient cell via cell-surface or endosomal receptors.
- Creation of a metastatic niche for cancer.
- Pathfinding through the environment.
- Quorum sensing.
- Mediating host-commensal or parasite/pathogen interaction. <sub>litmus</sub>
